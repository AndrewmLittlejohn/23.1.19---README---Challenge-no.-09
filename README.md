# 23.1.19---README---Challenge-no.-09


## Description

Challenge NO. 9 was to create and demonstrate via video and README.md file created with node npm extension(s). It is to be generated via a series of command line prompts, at which point a via README.md file will be created. 

I have enjoyed working on this project, I have learned a great deal of new things and have been able to use skills I have previsouly learned as well.

##### FYI

   The 'README.md' files created are currently named in fashion to demonstrate functionality of the created app have a varied names other than simply README.md to help differentiate from the README.md file that accompanies this work producing pages of this app.
